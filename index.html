<h1>DOOCN-XIV: Cascading Failures in Complex Networks</h1>
<h2>Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks 2023</h2>

<p class="location">
    The satellite will be held using Zoom Video Webinar system.
</p>

<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims on exploring statistical dynamics on and of complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks,
like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.
Understanding and analyzing cascading failures in complex networks have been the focus of
  research for years. However, the complex interactions among the large number of components in these
  systems and their contributions to cascading failures are not yet completely understood.
 This motivates us to focus on
<strong>"Cascading Failures in Complex Networks"</strong>
as the topic of interest in the 2023 edition.</p>

<p>Understanding and analyzing cascading failures in complex systems is an important task.
As an
example, cascading failures in power grids can be defined as successive interdependent failures of
components in the system, which are usually initiated by few outages due to internal or exogenous
disturbances and are propagated in a relatively short period of time leading to large blackouts. While
large blackouts are infrequent, their occurrence still has substantial risks associated with the
significant economic losses and social impacts that they cause. Various studies and models have
been developed to understand and control these complex phenomena.
Cascading failures can also occur in computer networks (such as the Internet) in which network traffic
is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or
disconnected hardware or software.
In finance, the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as systemic risk: the
failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions to fail, cascading throughout
the system.
Biochemical cascades exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications.
One negative example is ischemic cascade, in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill
off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released.
The vast application of the concept of cascading failures motivates us to focus on this specific
following theme this year.


<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XIV: Cascading Failures in Complex Networks; will be held on <strong>August 28-29, 2023</strong> in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="https://statphys28.org/">STATPHYS28 2023</a> conference
which will take place during 7&ndash;11 August 2023, in Tokyo, Japan although the workshop will be held online.

      <h4>Title: Scalable Network Embedding</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
      Network embedding consists in mapping the nodes of a graph in a low-dimensional space in order to preserve the topological structure of the network. These embedded vectors can then be used as features for various network mining tasks. Although most existing network embedding approaches use random walks, matrix factorization, or deep learning techniques to represent nodes, they are generally computationally expensive and cannot be used on large networks with billions of edges.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will first present the different network embedding solutions, and then I will detail LouvainNE, an embedding technique that uses a hierarchical clustering approach.  This solution builds a hierarchy of communities and a representation of the individual nodes in the original graph at different levels of the hierarchy which are then aggregated into the final vectors. I will show that this solution has a quasi linear runtime and a memory complexity in practice that allows it to process graphs containing tens of billions of edges. It is also very efficient for performing classical network exploration tasks such as network reconstruction and node classification. [<a href="files/guillaume-slides.pptx">Slides</a>]</p>

      <h4>Title: Recent Advances in Document Network Embedding</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Many sources of our informational landscape can be formalized as a document network (e.g., scientific papers, social media). For a long time the textual content of documents and the structure that encodes how documents relate to each other have been considered separately. Recently, document network embedding has been proposed to learn representations that take both content and structure into account. The new vector space can then be used for downstreams tasks, such as classification or link prediction. In this talk I will give an overview of recent methods that aim at building such embedding space. In particular, I will focus on several models that were recently proposed in the ERIC Lab.

      <h4>Title: Can you trust your GNN? &ndash; Adversarial Robustness of Machine Learning Models for Graphs</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Graph neural networks have recently achieved impressive results in many
graph learning tasks. Despite their proliferation, studies of their
robustness properties are still very limited &ndash; yet, in domains where
graph learning methods are often used, e.g. the web, adversaries are
common. In my talk, I will shed light on the aspect of adversarial
robustness for state-of-the art graph-based learning techniques. I will
highlight the unique challenges and opportunities that come along with
the graph setting and I will introduce perturbation approaches
showcasing the methods vulnerabilities. I will conclude with a
discussion of robustness certificates as well a learning principles for
improving robustness.</p>

      <h4>Title: Weg2Vec: Event Embedding for Temporal Networks</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Network embedding techniques are powerful to capture structural regularities in networks and to identify similarities between their local fabrics. However, conventional network embedding models are developed for static structures, commonly consider nodes only and they are seriously challenged when the network is varying in time. Temporal networks may provide an advantage in the description of real systems, but they code more complex information, which could be effectively represented only by a handful of methods so far. In this talk we introduce a new method of event embedding of temporal networks, called weg2vec, which builds on temporal and structural similarities of events to learn a low dimensional representation of a temporal network. This projection successfully captures latent structures and similarities between events involving different nodes at different times and provides ways to predict the final outcome of spreading processes unfolding on the temporal structure.

      <h4>Title: Low-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings of graphs: methods and applications.</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Graph embedding methods aim at learning representations of nodes that preserve graph properties (e.g. graph distances). These embeddings can then be used in downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Most machine learning algorithms learn embeddings into the standard Euclidean space. Recent research shows promise for more faithful embeddings by leveraging non-Euclidean geometries, such as hyperbolic or spherical geometries. In particular, trees can be embedded almost perfectly into hyperbolic space, while this is not possible in standard Euclidean space. In this talk, we review basic notions of hyperbolic geometry and then go over machine learning algorithms that learn embeddings into hyperbolic space. We cover a recent application of such embeddings, namely link prediction in Knowledge Graphs.</p>
