  <p>NetSci 2020 and with it DOOCN-XIII have been postponed
  because of the current COVID-19 situation.

<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims on exploring statistical dynamics on and of complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks,
like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.
Recently, machine learning techniques have been used
to model dynamics of massively large complex networks
generated from big data,
and the various functionalities resulting from the networks.
This motivates us to focus on
<strong>&ldquo;Network Learning&rdquo;</strong>
as the significant topic of interest in the 2020 edition.</p>

<p>As Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks have become increasingly popular,
researchers in Network Science have adopted its tools
to explore and study graphs and networks.
Graph Embedding or Network Representation Learning is one such tool
that aims to compute vector space representations
of nodes and edges of a network,
that capture their relations semantically.
Similarly Deep Neural Networks are being extensively used
in developing graph generative models
with the idea being a model trained on a graph of specific type
is able to generate graphs of similar types
without the explicit information of the underlying mechanism of edge formation.
Additionally, Deep Neural Network models have also been demonstrated
to be better equipped at link prediction
thereby expanding the repertoire of tools available
for studying network evolution.
We dub these areas of related research areas together as
<strong>&ldquo;Network Learning&rdquo;</strong>.

<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XIII: Network Learning&rdquo;
will be held in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="https://netsci2020.netscisociety.net/">NetSci 2020</a> conference,
<del>which will take place during 6&ndash;10 July 2020,
  in Rome, Italy.</del>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>The first Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN I)
took place in Dresden, Germany, on 4th October 2007,
as a satellite workshop of the European Conference on Complex Systems 07.
The workshop received a large number of quality submissions
from authors pursuing research in multiple disciplines,
thus making the forum truly inter-disciplinary.
There were around 20 speakers who spoke
about the dynamics on and of different systems
exhibiting a complex network structure,
from biological systems, linguistic systems, and social systems
to various technological systems
like the Internet, WWW, and peer-to-peer systems.
The organizing committee has published
some of the very high quality original submissions
as an edited volume from Birkhauser, Boston
describing contemporary research position in complex networks.</p>

<p>After the success of DOOCN I,
the organizers launched Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks – II (DOOCN II),
a two days satellite workshop
of the European Conference of Complex Systems 08.
DOOCN II was held in Jerusalem, Israel, on the 18th and 19th September 2008.</p>

<p>DOOCN III was held as a satellite of ECCS 2009
in the University of Warwick, UK on 23rd and 24th of September.
In continuation, DOOCN IV was held again as a satellite of ECCS 2010
in the University Institute Lisbon, Portugal on 16th September.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pks.mpg.de/~peruani/doocn2011/">DOOCN V</a>
was held as a satellite of ECCS 2011
in the University of Vienna on 14th – 15th September 2011.</p>

<p><a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2013.html">DOOCN VI</a>
took place in Barcelona, as a satellite to ECCS 2013,
and focused on Semiotic Dynamics in time-varying social media.
As DOOCN I, the other five DOOCN workshops
counted with a large number participants
and attracted prominent scientist in the field.</p>

<p><a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2014.html">DOOCN VII</a>,
held in Lucca as a satellite to ECCS 2014,
focused on Big Data aspects.
<a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2015.html">DOOCN VIII</a>
was held in Zaragoza with focus also on BigData aspects.</p>

<p>The 9th edition of <a href="http://doocnconf.wixsite.com/homepage">DOOCN</a>
was held in Amsterdam
at Conference on Complex Systems (CCS) with the theme
&ldquo;Mining and learning for complex networks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The 2017 edition of <a href="http://doocnconf.wixsite.com/doocn2017">DOOCN</a>
was held in Indianapolis USA
in conjunction with NetSci 2017.</p>

<p>The 2018 edition of <a href="http://doocn.org/2018">DOOCN XI</a>
was held in Thessaloniki, Greece
at Conference on Complex Systems (CCS) with the theme
&ldquo;Machine learning for complex networks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The 2019 edition of <a href="http://doocn.org/2019">DOOCN XII</a>
was held in Burlington, Vermont, USA
in conjunction with NetSci 2019 with the theme
&ldquo;Network Representation Learning&rdquo;.</p>
