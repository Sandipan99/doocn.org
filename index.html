<h1>DOOCN-XII: Network Representation Learning</h1>
<h2>Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks 2019</h2>

<p class="location">
  Frank Room of the UVM Davis Center<br>
  University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA<br>
  Tuesday, May 28th 2019 1:45pm&ndash;5:30pm</p>

<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims on exploring statistical dynamics on and of complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks,
like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.
Recently, machine learning techniques have been used
to model dynamics of massively large complex networks
generated from big data,
and the various functionalities resulting from the networks.
This motivates us to focus on
<strong>&ldquo;Network Representation Learning&rdquo;</strong>
as the significant topic of interest in the 2019 edition.</p>


<p>Network Representation Learning or Graph Embedding is a technique
that aims to compute vector space representations
of nodes and edges of a network,
that capture their relations semantically.
Recently Network Representation Learning has seen a lot of research focus
from the Network Science community
for its ability to automatically capture
different sorts of complex semantic relations
between components of a graph without explicit programming.</p>

<p>The 12<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XII: Network Representation Learning&rdquo;
will be held in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="http://www.netsci2019.net/">NetSci 2019</a> conference,
which will take place during 27&ndash;31 May 2019,
in Burlington, Vermont, USA.

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>The first Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN I)
took place in Dresden, Germany, on 4th October 2007,
as a satellite workshop of the European Conference on Complex Systems 07.
The workshop received a large number of quality submissions
from authors pursuing research in multiple disciplines,
thus making the forum truly inter-disciplinary.
There were around 20 speakers who spoke
about the dynamics on and of different systems
exhibiting a complex network structure,
from biological systems, linguistic systems, and social systems
to various technological systems
like the Internet, WWW, and peer-to-peer systems.
The organizing committee has published
some of the very high quality original submissions
as an edited volume from Birkhauser, Boston
describing contemporary research position in complex networks.</p>

<p>After the success of DOOCN I,
the organizers launched Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks – II (DOOCN II),
a two days satellite workshop
of the European Conference of Complex Systems 08.
DOOCN II was held in Jerusalem, Israel, on the 18th and 19th September 2008.</p>

<p>DOOCN III was held as a satellite of ECCS 2009
in the University of Warwick, UK on 23rd and 24th of September.
In continuation, DOOCN IV was held again as a satellite of ECCS 2010
in the University Institute Lisbon, Portugal on 16th September.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pks.mpg.de/~peruani/doocn2011/">DOOCN V</a>
was held as a satellite of ECCS 2011
in the University of Vienna on 14th – 15th September 2011.</p>

<p><a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2013.html">DOOCN VI</a>
took place in Barcelona, as a satellite to ECCS 2013,
and focused on Semiotic Dynamics in time-varying social media.
As DOOCN I, the other five DOOCN workshops
counted with a large number participants
and attracted prominent scientist in the field.</p>

<p><a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2014.html">DOOCN VII</a>,
held in Lucca as a satellite to ECCS 2014,
focused on Big Data aspects.
<a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/DOOCN2015.html">DOOCN VIII</a>
was held in Zaragoza with focus also on BigData aspects.</p>

<p>The 9th edition of <a href="http://doocnconf.wixsite.com/homepage">DOOCN</a>
was held in Amsterdam
at Conference on Complex Systems (CCS) with the theme
&ldquo;Mining and learning for complex networks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The 2017 edition of <a href="http://doocnconf.wixsite.com/doocn2017">DOOCN</a>
was held in Indianapolis USA
in conjunction with NetSci 2017.</p>

<p>The 2018 edition of <a href="http://doocn.org/2018">DOOCN XI</a>
was held in Thessaloniki, Greece
at Conference on Complex Systems (CCS) with the theme
&ldquo;Machine learning for complex networks&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="books">DOOCN Book Series</h3>

<p>
The organizing committees of the DOOCN workshop series
have published two Birkhäuser book volumes,
from selected talks from the series,
