<h2 id="dovrolis">The hourglass effect in hierarchical dependency networks</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Prof. Constantine Dovrolis, Georgia Tech, USA</h3>

<p>
Many hierarchically modular systems are structured in a way that resembles an
hourglass. This &ldquo;hourglass effect&rdquo; means that the system generates many outputs
from many inputs through a relatively small number of intermediate modules that
are critical for the operation of the entire system, referred to as the waist of
the hourglass. We investigate the hourglass effect in general, not necessarily
layered, hierarchical dependency networks. Our analysis focuses on the number of
source-to-target dependency paths that traverse each vertex, and it identifies
the core of a dependency network as the smallest set of vertices that
collectively cover almost all dependency paths. We then examine if a given
network exhibits the hourglass property or not, comparing its core size with
a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; (i.e., non-hierarchical) network that preserves the source dependencies
of each target in the original network. As a possible explanation for the
hourglass effect, we propose the Reuse Preference model that captures the bias
of new modules to reuse intermediate modules of similar complexity instead of
connecting directly to sources or low complexity modules. We have applied the
proposed framework in a diverse set of dependency networks from technological,
natural, and information systems, showing that all these networks exhibit the
general hourglass property but to a varying degree and with different waist
characteristics.

<h2 class="push-down" id="bianconi">Emergent complex network geometry and frustrated synchronization</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Prof. Ginestra Bianconi, Queen Mary University of London, UK</h3>

<p>
The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be
strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their
dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from
the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between network
geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of
a simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The
networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite
Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable
spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated synchronization
for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators, and that the
synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral dimension of
the network.

<h2 class="push-down" id="radicchi">Characterizing the analogy between hyperbolic embedding and community structure of complex networks</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Prof. Filippo Radicchi, Indiana University, USA</h3>

<p>
In this talk, I'll show that the community structure of a network can be used as
a coarse version of its embedding in a hidden space with hyperbolic geometry.
The finding emerges from a systematic analysis of several real-world and
synthetic networks. I'll take advantage of the analogy for reinterpreting
results originally obtained through network hyperbolic embedding in terms of
community structure only. First, I'll show that the robustness of a multiplex
network can be controlled by tuning the correlation between the community
structures across different layers. Second, I'll deploy an efficient greedy
protocol for network navigability that makes use of routing tables based on
community structure.

<h2 class="push-down" id="gomez">Competition in two-layer multiplex networks</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Prof. Sergio Gómez, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain</h3>

<p>
The coexistence of multiple types of interactions within social, technological
and biological networks has moved the focus of the physics of complex systems
towards a multiplex description of the interactions between their constituents.
Here we address an important issue that is intrinsic to the coexistence of
multiple means of interactions within a network: their competition. To this aim,
we study a two-layer multiplex in which the activity of users can be localized
in each of the layers or shared between them, favoring that neighboring nodes
within a layer focus their activity on the same layer. This framework mimics the
coexistence and competition of multiple communication channels, in a way that
the prevalence of a particular communication platform emerges as a result of the
localization of users activity in one single interaction layer. Our results
indicate that there is a transition from localization (use of a preferred layer)
to delocalization (combined usage of both layers) and that the prevalence of
a particular layer (in the localized state) depends on their structural
properties. To obtain these results, advanced optimization techniques are needed
since standard methods fail to capture the ground state. In particular, we have
selected Particle Swarm Optimization, one of the outstanding Swarm Intelligence
methodologies.

<h2 class="push-down" id="mellor">Understanding collective behaviour in temporal networks</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Dr. Andrew Mellor, University of Oxford, UK</h3>

<p>Networks are often modelled using global connection rules where the presence of
edges is prescribed at the network level (e.g. Erdős–Rényi networks) however
these models can potentially neglect more complex interactions between nodes in
the formation of the network.</p>

<p>In this talk we study the behaviour of collections of nodes by considering
a topological and temporal decomposition of temporal network.</p>

<p>Characterizing the behaviour of these collectives using both temporal and static
features to create an feature-space embedding we show that the temporal network
is comprised of many distinct behaviours whose prevalence also varies over time.</p>

<p>This suggests that to model certain systems we may need to consider all of
individual, local, and global interactions in unison.<p>

<p>Switching our focus to dynamics on networks, we further we show that the same
methods can be used to characterise dynamical processes (such as the spread of
infection) on an underlying network.<p>


<h2 class="push-down" id="peel">Multiscale mixing patterns in networks</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Dr. Leto Peel, Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium</h3>

<p>Assortative mixing in networks is the tendency for nodes with the same
attributes, or metadata, to link to each other. It is a property often found in
social networks manifesting as a higher tendency of links occurring between
people with the same age, race, or political belief. Quantifying the level of
assortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with
different attributes) can shed light on the factors involved in the formation of
links and contagion processes in complex networks. It is common practice to
measure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient,
or modularity in the case of discrete-valued metadata. This global value is the
average level of assortativity across the network and may not be
a representative statistic when mixing patterns are heterogeneous. For example,
a social network spanning the globe may exhibit local differences in mixing
patterns as a consequence of differences in cultural norms. Here, we introduce
an approach to localise this global measure so that we can describe the
assortativity, across multiple scales, at the node level. Consequently we are
able to capture and qualitatively evaluate the distribution of mixing patterns
in the network. We find that for many real-world networks the distribution of
assortativity is skewed, overdispersed and multimodal. Our method provides
a clearer lens through which we can more closely examine mixing patterns in
networks.</p>

<h2 class="push-down" id="sikdar">ComPAS: Community preserving sampling for streaming graphs</h2>
<h3>Speaker: Dr. Sandipan Sikdar, RWTH Aachen, Germany</h3>

<p>In the era of big data, graph sampling is indispensable in many settings.
Existing sampling methods are mostly designed for static graphs, and aim to
preserve basic structural properties of the original graph (such as degree
distribution, clustering coefficient etc.) in the sample. We argue that for any
sampling method it is impossible to produce an universal representative sample
which can preserve all the properties of the original graph; rather sampling
should be application specific (such as preserving hubs - needed for information
diffusion). Here we consider community detection as an application scenario. We
propose ComPAS, a novel sampling strategy that unlike previous methods, is not
only designed for streaming graphs (which is a more realistic representation of
a real-world scenario) but also preserves the community structure of the
original graph in the sample. Empirical results on both synthetic and different
real-world graphs show that ComPAS is the best to preserve the underlying
community structure.</p>
